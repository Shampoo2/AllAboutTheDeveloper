      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p style="font-family :cursive"> Hello, I'm Sergio Alexander Perez. I'm 15 years old and about to be 16. I made this website so people who are getting to know me can see how my life is and how it is to live with me and to live what I have experienced. This website will contain where I went for vacation, my dream car, and a get to know me section.</p>

<h2>What made me choose coding</h2>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;"> Hello guys, my passion for coding started when I was 10 years old but before I wanted to be a YouTuber until reality hit me and said "There is no guarantee that you will become a YouTuber" So one day I saw my uncle practicing code and as I saw him coding I enjoyed the way the software looked and how challenging it looks so that when I started to ask him a bunch of questions about coding and programming and he was happy enough to tell all about it. After he told me all about it I tried it and I saw how hard it is but enjoyable to do as a 10-year-old I didn't try at all and started to play video games and waste my time but at the age of 14 when it hit me and I said to myself "I have to stop with the baby stuff and start practicing code and prepare for the future".I started to code now and then but when I turned 15 years old that's when the gear kicked in and I started to invest more time in coding as I'm about to turn 16 this is the year that I'm going to go hard and prepare for the future as coding is going to be my future job.What i also like about coding is.

    <h2>my origin and my family origin</h2>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"> But let's go back to how my life is. so I live with my dad and my grandma and they are supportive of me and I'm grateful to them for taking care of me and not letting me do whatever I want to do hahaha. My family is from the Dominican Republic. I was born here in the United States but I spent a lot of time in the Dominican Republic with my grandma and eventually lived there for about a year or 2.</p>

    <h2>All about my Cousins</h2>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"> I have 4 cousins that I talk to a lot. their name is Michael, Jansel, Christian, and David. If I'm going to be honest they are not your average cousin. They are hyper, a little weird, and to be honest, they come up with the craziest ideas you will ever hear but that's what I like about them and that's what makes them my cousins. </p>

    <h2>My birth date</h2>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"> So i was born on october 18,2007 and i know my birthday is coming uo in a couple of days and im excited becuase 16 is a big number.Im not really sure what i will do for my birthday but as long as i spend time with my grandma and my dad and my family im fine with whatever happens on my birthday.The funny thing is as the whole day is going and we are celebrating my birthday im still 15 because i was born at 11:47pm. I know its funny and i always joke with myself and say i was almost born on the 19th of october.I dont really mind at all and its actually a good thing because when its close to 11:47 i just look at the moon and skies and think to myself "another moon to remember because its a special one"</p>

    <h2>My routine</h2>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"> Let's get back to the topic though. So my routine that I follow from morning until night time is to Brush my teeth, Put clothes on, get my bookbag ready, and go off to school. When I get to school I say hi to my friends and start walking to class. As soon as I get to my class I go to my seat and just get out my Chromebook and wait for the teacher to teach. After class ends I go to my other classes but you get the gist. After school, I go home and lie on my bed because of how tired I am from school. I don't let school stop me from doing what I have to do though. So I get up eat, play basketball, spend time with my dad, and play video games with my cousin. Toward the end of the day, I start coding and making small adjustments to my website. Sometimes I'm looking at tutorials on how to learn javascript and other languages but after coding. I brush my teeth and I go to sleep at 9 or 10 pm And that's it I repeat the same thing sometimes I do things around the house or not and sometimes I go out with my dad or not.</p>
